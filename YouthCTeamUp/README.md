## Description  
This certificate recognizes my active participation and successful collaboration in the Global IoT Project for Infectious Diseases Control (Water Monitoring) as part of the YouthCTeamUp initiative, co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.

The project aimed to develop innovative IoT-based solutions to monitor water quality and help control the spread of infectious diseases globally. Working closely with an international team of motivated peers and experts, we designed and implemented a system that collects, analyzes, and reports critical water data in real time, enabling timely intervention and improved public health outcomes.

During the project, I utilized Python programming extensively, leveraging powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data processing, analysis, and visualization. I also applied data science techniques to clean sensor data, detect anomalies, and generate actionable insights, which supported decision-making for water safety monitoring.

This experience enhanced my skills in:

Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and sensor integration

Data collection, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis using Python

Visualizing real-time data trends with Python libraries for effective communication

Collaborative project management in a multicultural team

Problem-solving for global health challenges

Promoting sustainability and health through technology

The YouthCTeamUp program fosters innovation, teamwork, and social impact among young professionals and students, encouraging the development of practical solutions to pressing global issues.

I am proud to have contributed to this impactful project, demonstrating how Python and data science can be harnessed to create meaningful technological solutions for public health worldwide.
