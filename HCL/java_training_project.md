## Description

This certificate acknowledges the successful completion of a 6-week training program in **Core Java**, during which I developed a functional desktop application titled **Patient Management System**.
The project aimed to streamline the handling of patient information, enabling users to add, update, delete, and retrieve patient records. The application included user-friendly forms and a structured interface built using Java Swing components.

## Skills Acquired

- Core Java programming (classes, objects, constructors, inheritance)  
- Designing and implementing GUI using **Java Swing**  
- Developing multi-form applications for data input and display  
- Managing patient records with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality  
- Implementing basic file storage or simulated backend logic  
- Applying form validation and simple input handling  
- Understanding application flow and user-driven interactions  

This project strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming and laid the groundwork for developing real-world software applications.
