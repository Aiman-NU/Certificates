## Description

As part of the 6-week Core Java training program at HCL Career Development Centre, I successfully developed a **Patient Management System**, applying principles of object-oriented programming, Java application architecture, and user interface design.
This project involved designing and implementing features that allowed for patient record management, appointment scheduling, and data storageâ€”all built using Java SE and Swing for the interface. The training emphasized hands-on development, real-world use cases, and best practices in Java programming.

## Skills Acquired

- Core Java programming and object-oriented design principles  
- Creating Java classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation  
- Building GUI-based desktop applications using **Java Swing**  
- Implementing form validation and event handling  
- Integrating front-end interfaces with basic file/database-like backends  
- Managing structured data and implementing CRUD operations  
- Modular programming and clean code structuring  
- Debugging and exception handling in Java  
- Exposure to basic project planning, software documentation, and teamwork  
- Understanding real-world healthcare domain logic via application simulation

This project laid a strong foundation for software development, Java application design, and real-world problem solving through coding.
