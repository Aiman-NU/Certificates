## Description

This foundational course introduced the core concepts of **SAS programming**, designed to equip participants with the essential skills required to read, manipulate, and analyze data using the SAS System. The training provided a strong base for performing data preparation, transformation, and basic reporting tasks.
Through hands-on examples and guided practice, I developed proficiency in using the **DATA step**, basic **PROCs**, and SAS syntax to work efficiently with structured data. The course also emphasized understanding the SAS environment, libraries, and workflow needed for effective data handling.

## Skills Acquired

- Understanding the SAS environment and how to navigate the SAS interface  
- Writing and executing **DATA steps** to read, manipulate, and create datasets  
- Importing external data into SAS (e.g., raw text files, CSV)  
- Using **PROC PRINT**, **PROC MEANS**, and **PROC FREQ** to generate reports and summaries  
- Managing datasets with **SET**, **MERGE**, and conditional logic in the DATA step  
- Creating new variables, subsetting data, and applying conditional logic  
- Exploring basic **data validation** and **data cleaning** techniques  
- Understanding **SAS libraries** and the role of temporary vs. permanent datasets  
- Using **formats and labels** to enhance data presentation and readability  
- Debugging and correcting syntax errors in SAS programs

This course served as the first step in building a solid foundation in SAS programming, essential for data management, statistical analysis, and reporting in both academic and industry settings.
