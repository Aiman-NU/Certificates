## Description

This course introduced the use of **Structured Query Language (SQL)** within the SAS environment, focusing on essential concepts for querying, managing, and manipulating data stored in SAS datasets.
Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, I developed practical skills in data extraction, filtering, sorting, summarization, and combining data from multiple sources using **PROC SQL**. The training emphasized how to use SQL efficiently for data preparation and reporting tasks in SAS.
This course laid a strong foundation for using SQL as a tool for data manipulation, especially in data analysis, reporting, and integration tasks within a SAS workflow.

## Skills Acquired

- Writing **basic SQL queries** using `PROC SQL` to access and manipulate SAS datasets  
- Using `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses  
- Creating **summary statistics** using aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, and `MIN`  
- Performing **table joins** (inner, left, right, and full joins) to combine multiple datasets  
- Applying **set operators** such as `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` to merge query results  
- Subsetting data with conditional expressions and logical operators  
- Creating new variables in queries using calculated fields  
- Using subqueries for more advanced data retrieval scenarios  
- Understanding how SQL integrates with SAS for efficient and readable code  
- Enhancing data preparation workflows for analysis and reporting

This training strengthened my ability to work with data directly within SAS using SQL, enabling faster and more efficient data wrangling in analytics and reporting projects.
