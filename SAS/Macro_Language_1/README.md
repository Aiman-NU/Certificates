**Recipient**: Aiman Alam  
**Course**: SAS® Macro Language 1: Essentials  
**Date Granted**: October 8, 2021  
**Location**: Live Web  
**CEUs Earned**: 1.5  
**Instructor**: Ritu Shekon  
**Issuing Organization**: SAS Institute Inc.

## Description

This course provided a comprehensive introduction to the **SAS Macro Language**, an essential component of advanced SAS programming used to automate repetitive tasks, create dynamic code, and simplify complex programs.
Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and real-world examples, I gained practical experience in writing and debugging macro programs that enhance the reusability, efficiency, and flexibility of SAS code.
The training covered how to use macro variables and macro functions, create and manage macro programs, and generate dynamic SAS code to reduce redundancy in data manipulation and reporting tasks.

## Skills Acquired

- Understanding the role and purpose of the SAS Macro Language in programming automation
- Creating and referencing **macro variables** (automatic, global, and local)
- Writing **macro programs** with `%MACRO` and `%MEND`
- Using **macro functions** such as `%EVAL`, `%SYSEVALF`, `%SUBSTR`, and others
- Conditional processing and looping in macro programs using `%IF-%THEN`, `%DO-%END`
- Generating dynamic and reusable SAS code using macro logic
- Incorporating macro code into standard SAS programs
- Debugging and troubleshooting macro programs effectively
- Improving code maintainability and performance in large-scale data projects

This training strengthened my ability to write modular, scalable, and efficient SAS programs—crucial for data automation and analytics tasks in professional environments.
